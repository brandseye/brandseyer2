  - title: "Authenticating"
    desc: >
      Authentication is the first thing that you should do when
      using the library. It allows you to identify yourself
      with our API, and lets you know what accounts and brands you have
      access to.

      - authenticate
      - whoami
  - title: "Accounts"

      These functions allow you to determine what accounts you have
      access to, and to query information about them, such as the brands
      that you are tracking, and the tags and topics in each account.
    contents:
      - account
      - is.account
      - account_brands
      - root_brands
      - starts_with("account_")
  - title: "Accessing mentions"
    desc: >
      Mentions make up the raw data that we store for you. Sentiment
      information and topic information are stored against individual
      mentions. These functions allow you to query for particular
      kinds of mentions using a filter language, to count mentions
      matching particular parameters, and to update the information
      stored on mentions.
