      These are the basic steps that you need to take in order to get data
      using brandseyer2. First, ensure that you have authenticated yourself,
      then reference an account, then access that account's mentions.
      See the [Get started](../articles/brandseyer2.html) documentation for more
      details.

      Authentication is the first thing that you should do when
      using the library. It allows you to identify yourself
      with our API, and lets you know what accounts and brands you have
      access to.

      These functions allow you to determine what accounts you have
      access to, and to query information about them, such as the brands
      that you are tracking, and the tags and topics in each account.

    desc: >
      Mentions make up the raw data that we store for you. Sentiment
      information and topic information are stored against individual
      mentions. These functions allow you to query for particular
      kinds of mentions using a filter language, to count mentions
      matching particular parameters, and to update the information
      stored on mentions.

      Important functions include [mentions()](mentions.html) to pull mentions in your account,
      and [count_mentions()](count_mentions.html), to count mentions matching a particular filter.

    desc: >
      Often, when counting or fetching mentions, you may need to specify
      a filter, or the brands in the filter, and so on. The query language
      lets you easily define these things, as well as avoid specify brands
      in each and every filter. The [Get started](../articles/brandseyer2.html)
      guide discusses this in more detail.

      Most actions on user accounts are logged. brandseyer2 provides various
      functions to read and filter account logs, starting with the

      people can set up dashboards to query our data. We have various functions
      that help you to read data from the dashboards, their various sub-sections,
      an the metrics that they contain.
