This will provide an introduction to filtering for data in BrandsEye

BrandsEye's API supports a small language to help you select exactly the mentions
that you want to select. You'll do this with the help of the `mentions()` function,
which always expects a filter.

```{r}
library(brandseyer2)

account("TEST01AA") %>% 
  mentions(filter = "published inthelast week")  
```
